Single File/Folder using pull:
adb pull "/sdcard/Folder1"
Output:
adb pull "/sdcard/Folder1"
pull: building file list...
pull: /sdcard/Folder1/image1.jpg -> ./image1.jpg
pull: /sdcard/Folder1/image2.jpg -> ./image2.jpg
pull: /sdcard/Folder1/image3.jpg -> ./image3.jpg
3 files pulled. 0 files skipped.

Specific Files/Folders using find from BusyBox:
adb shell find "/sdcard/Folder1" -iname "*.jpg" | tr -d '\015' | while read line; do adb pull $line; done;

Here is an explanation:

adb shell find "/sdcard/Folder1" - use the find command, use the top folder
-iname "*.jpg"                   - filter the output to only *.jpg files
|                                - passes data(output) from one command to another
tr -d '\015'                     - explained here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9664086/bash-is-removing-commands-in-while
while read line;                 - while loop to read input of previous commands
do adb pull $line; done;         - pull the files into the current running directory, finish
The scripts will start in the top folder and recursively go down and find all the "*.jpg" files and pull them from your phone to the current directory.
